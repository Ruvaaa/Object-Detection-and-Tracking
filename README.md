Object Tracking with YOLO and OpenCV

Overview

This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. The system detects objects, tracks them, and periodically re-detects to maintain accuracy.

Features

âœ… Real-time object detection using YOLOv8âœ… Object tracking with OpenCV's CSRT trackerâœ… Periodic re-detection for improved accuracyâœ… User-controlled start and stop for detectionâœ… Live video feed display

Requirements

Before running the project, install the required dependencies:

pip install ultralytics opencv-python

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-tracker.git
cd object-tracker

Run the script:

python tracker.py

Press 's' to start detection and 'q' to quit.
